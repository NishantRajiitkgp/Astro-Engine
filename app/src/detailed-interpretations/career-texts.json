However, Saturn also rewards genuine effort. If you've been building authentically, this transit can bring recognition, promotion, or confirmation that you're on the right path.\n\nMany people experience significant career turning points during this transit—taking on new levels of responsibility, making major professional commitments, or clearing away what no longer serves their true path.
