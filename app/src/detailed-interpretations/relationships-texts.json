There is little room for superficiality under Pluto's penetrating gaze. This transit demands authenticity in love.\n\nOld wounds around love, self-worth, and desire come up for transformation. You may revisit past relationship traumas, this time with the power to heal them completely. Your values undergo fundamental change—what you desired before may no longer appeal, replaced by deeper, more authentic attractions.\n\nThis is a death and rebirth of your capacity to love.

The person you attract during this time is likely to be beneficial to your growth—someone who expands your horizons, shares your faith in life, or comes from a different background that enriches your perspective.\n\nExisting relationships flourish under Jupiter's generous rays. You may experience expansion in partnership through marriage, moving in together, starting a family, or embarking on shared adventures. Your partner may receive good fortune that benefits the relationship, or you may find yourselves growing together in ways that bring mutual joy.\n\nBusiness partnerships and collaborative ventures also prosper. If you've been considering going into business with someone, this transit provides favorable conditions.

Occurring every 29 years, this transit demands that you take relationships seriously, testing existing bonds while establishing foundations for lasting commitment.\n\nThis may not feel like the most romantic period. Saturn brings responsibilities, realities, and sometimes restrictions to the areas it touches. In your partnership house, this translates to increased awareness of what relationships truly require—beyond the honeymoon phase and into the realm of genuine commitment.\n\nExisting relationships undergo rigorous testing. Those built on solid foundations of mutual respect, shared values, and genuine commitment will strengthen, even if they require more work during this time. Relationships lacking substance cannot hide from Saturn's discerning eye—endings during this period, while painful, clear the way for more authentic connections.\n\nIf you're single, you may feel lonelier than usual, or dating may feel like more effort than it's worth. However, serious relationships formed during this transit often prove extraordinarily durable. You're not interested in games or superficiality—you want something real, and Saturn will help you find it if you're willing to do the work.\n\nThis is a time for becoming a better partner yourself. Where have you been immature, avoidant, or irresponsible in relationships? Saturn asks you to grow up in your approach to love. The discipline you develop now creates the container for lasting love to flourish."
